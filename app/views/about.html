                <p><strong>Algoland.NET</strong> is a portal where you'll find popular algorithms explained and implemented with C#.
                When you're preparing to the interview or just studying computer science, you find most code examples written in Java or C++.
                Sometimes you really want to find implementation in a particular language since build-in class libraries and language constructs differ.</p>
                <p>If you are in love with C# or just looking for an algorithm example written in C#, Algoland.NET is for you.</p>
